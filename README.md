# attiny84-transistor-high-current-control


### The concept is to control high voltage devices (over 5v) with TIP120 power transistor and attiny85 arduino compatible chip.


#1  Program attiny85 with arduino in order to get familiar with uploading arduino code to attiny chip-> https://www.hackster.io/arjun/programming-attiny85-with-arduino-uno-afb829

#2 Go through instructable  to get familiar with TIP120 transistor controlled by arduino-> http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-Arduino-with-TIP120-transistor-to-control-moto/ 

#3 Combine the above knowledge by using the file provided and make the correct connections as seen (circuit will be provided, but in essence it is a simplified version of the above examples).


(I used a 12V - LED tape for running the example) and the result is  a simplified version of the  arduino TIP120 transistor example.
