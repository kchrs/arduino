Atmel Attiny85 controlling TIP120 (arduino code)
Example for controlling TIP120 with Attiny85
Go through both articles and check programs and steps
#1  Program attiny85 with arduino-> https://www.hackster.io/arjun/programming-attiny85-with-arduino-uno-afb829

#2 Use arduino with TIP120 transistor -> http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-Arduino-with-TIP120-transistor-to-control-moto/ 

#Combine both, make the connections (I used a 12V - LED tape for running the example) and the result is  a simplified version of the TIP120 example.

###The idea is to control high voltage with TIP120 transistor with attiny85 (arduino compatible inexpensive  2 dolar chip :-)
